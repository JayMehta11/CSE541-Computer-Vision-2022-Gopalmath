# Introduction
A brain tumour is described as a malignant or noncancerous mass in the brain that develops aberrant cells.This area includes techniques such as tumour identification and classification, malignant region detection and classification, testing, and inspection of critical sections of the human brain. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is used to diagnose brain tumours (MRI). Magnetic resonance segmentation is used in a difficult clinical imaging process to isolate the questionable regions. Although brain tumour diagnosis is still a manual process that is inspected and certified by specialists, MRI is the most often used process that highlights the tumorous region in the brain. As a result, we need a compelling procedure to detect brain cancers early on and save patients with high accuracy. For each required contrast, these methods frequently necessitate a significant number of manually segmented preprocessed photos.
